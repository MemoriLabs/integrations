# Memori for Claude Code: quickstart

## Before you start

You need three values from your Memori administrator or dashboard:

- **API URL**, such as `https://api.memorilabs.ai`
- **Identity ID**, which starts with `id_`
- **Entity ID**, a lowercase name for the person whose memories this plugin
  should use, such as `jane-doe`

Double-check your identity ID and entity ID. The identity ID should match the one shown in your dashboard, and your entity ID is entered during the configure step. If the identity ID is mistyped or you forget to enter an entity ID, you won’t see memories stored or recalled in your assigned pools. A mistyped entity ID won’t error either - memories will be created under the wrong entity, so the dashboard will look off. If your memory dashboard looks off, verify these two values first.

Once enabled and configured, the plugin sends your full conversation to your
Memori server with no redaction: prompts, replies, tool calls, tool results and
attachments. See [what gets sent](../README.md#privacy-what-gets-sent) before enabling
it somewhere that matters.

## 1. Install

```
claude plugin marketplace add MemoriLabs/integrations
claude plugin install memori@memorilabs
claude plugin enable memori@memorilabs
```

The plugin starts disabled, so the final command is required. Then start a new
session so the hooks load.

## 2. Configure

Start a session and run:

```
/memori:configure
```

Claude asks for the three values and writes them to
`~/.claude/memori/config.json`, readable only by you. Give them in one go if you
prefer:

```
/memori:configure https://api.memorilabs.ai id_your_identity_id_here jane-doe
```

Run it again any time to see what is set or to change something.

## 3. Check if it worked

Ask Claude:

> Is Memori working?

It reads your configuration back; the check itself does not contact your Memori server and changes nothing.

That is it. Memori now recalls relevant memories before each prompt and captures
new ones after each completed turn.

## If something is wrong

Nothing else about the plugin is visible from inside a session: the only thing it
ever adds to a conversation is the memories it recalled, so a failure is silent
by design. Work through these in order.

- Confirm the plugin is enabled with `claude plugin list`.
- Confirm your configuration with `/memori:configure`, and that every Memori
  client uses the same entity ID.
- Check the Memori dashboard, the only place that shows whether memories are
  accumulating. On a new account it stays empty until a turn or two has been
  captured and extracted.
- Read the hook's own errors:

  ```
  claude --debug-file memori.log
  ```

  A rejected identity ID, an entity that cannot read its pool, a URL that is not
  a Memori server, and a config file that cannot be parsed are all written there
  in full.

## Uninstalling

Removing the plugin leaves `~/.claude/memori/config.json` behind, which holds
your settings and identity ID. Delete `~/.claude/memori/` if you want it gone.
